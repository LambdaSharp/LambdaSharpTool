# LambdaSharp Command Line

The LambdaSharp CLI is used to process the module definition, compile the C# projects, upload their packages to S3, generate a CloudFormation stack, and then create or update it. All operations are done in a single pass to facilitate greater productivity when building new LambdaSharp module. In addition, LambdaSharp uses a deterministic build process which enables it to skip updates when no code or configuration changes have occurred since the last deployment operation.
