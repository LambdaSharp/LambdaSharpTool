# Delete Orphaned Lambda and API Gateway V1/V2 CloudWatch Logs Command

The `util delete-orphan-logs` command is used to delete CloudWatch log groups that were created by Lambda functions and API Gateway V1/V2 instances which no longer exist. Note, Î»# modules always clean up their Lambda and API Gateway V1/V2 logs. However, if you have been experimenting with Lambda or API Gateway V1/V2 in the past, you may have a lot of CloudWatch logs that are lingering for no reason. This command will take care of them.

## Options

<dl>

<dt><code>--dryrun;</code></dt>

(optional) Show the result of the clean-up operation without deleting anything
</dd>

<dt><code>--aws-profile|-P &lt;NAME&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>

(optional) Use a specific AWS profile from the AWS credentials file
</dd>
