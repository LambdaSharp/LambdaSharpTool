# Operational Events

LambdaSharp modules can emit operational [CloudWatch events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html) on the default [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) when _Core Services_ are enabled. These events correspond to runtime errors, function usage, as well as custom CloudWatch metrics.

## Overview

The operational events are only emitted when _Core Services_ is enabled, because they are generated by the _Lambdasharp.Core_ module when ingesting the CloudWatch logs from the Lambda functions.

The following operational events are emitted:
1. [LambdaError Event](Events-LambdaError.md) when an error or warning is reported by a Lambda function either by the Lambda code itself or by the Lambda runtime.
1. [LambdaMetrics Event](Events-LambdaMetrics.md) when the Lambda function emits a custom CloudWatch metrics record.
1. [LambdaUsage Event](Events-LambdaUsage.md) when a Lambda function has completed its execution.

## Schema

The LambdaSharp events follow the CloudWatch Events schema with some values consistently filled in so they can be used to subscribe to specific events reliably.

```yaml
source: $MODULE_FULL_NAME
detail-type: $EVENT_TYPE
detail: JSON # event type specific
resources:
    - lambdasharp:stack:$STACK_ID
    - lambdasharp:module:$MODULE_FULL_NAME
    - lambdasharp:tier:$DEPLOYMENT_TIER
```

|Variable           |Description    |
|-------------------|---------------|
|`$DEPLOYMENT_TIER` |The name of the deployment tier. Empty value for the default deployment tier.
|`$EVENT_TYPE`      |The event type emitted. One of `LambdaError`, `LambdaMetrics`, or `LambdaUsage`.
|`$MODULE_FULL_NAME`|Full name of the originating module (e.g. `My.Module`).
|`$STACK_ID`        |The ID of the CloudFormation stack that was created for the module deployment.
