## Getting Started

It's easy to get started building Serverless .NET application on AWS with LambdaSharp. In in this 10 minute tutorial, we will install the LambdaSharp CLI, create a configuration for it, and a deployment tier for your LambdaSharp modules. Along the way, I will explain what resources are part of the configuration and deployment tier and what purpose they play.

In this video, I'm going through the steps for creating your first Serverless .NET module for AWS using  LambdaSharp. The whole tutorial takes less than 10 minutes. Along the way, I also show how to use CloudFormation parameters to parametrize your module and show how they are resolved interactively at deployment time.
