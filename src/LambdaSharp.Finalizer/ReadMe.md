# LambdaSharp.Finalizer

This package contains interfaces and classes used for building Lambda functions on AWS. The finalizer is a special kind of Lambda function that is invoked at the end of a CloudFormation stack creation or update operation, or at the beginning of a stack delete operation. This package extends the functionality provided the [LambdaSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LambdaSharp/) package.

## ALambdaFinalizerFunction

The `ALambdaFinalizerFunction` base class implements the LambdaSharp protocol for CloudFormation stack create, update, and delete operations. This function is can be used to initialize data stores on creation or migrate data between versions.

```csharp
public sealed class Function : ALambdaFinalizerFunction {

    //--- Methods ---
    public override async Task InitializeAsync(LambdaConfig config) {

        // TO-DO: add function initialization and reading configuration settings
    }

    public override async Task CreateDeploymentAsync(FinalizerProperties current, CancellationToken cancellationToken) {

        // TO-DO: add business logic when creating a CloudFormation stack
    }

    public override async Task UpdateDeploymentAsync(FinalizerProperties current, FinalizerProperties previous, CancellationToken cancellationToken) {

        // TO-DO: add business logic when updating a CloudFormation stack
    }

    public override async Task DeleteDeploymentAsync(FinalizerProperties current, CancellationToken cancellationToken) {

        // TO-DO: add business logic when deleting a CloudFormation stack
    }
}
```
