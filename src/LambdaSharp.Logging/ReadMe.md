# LambdaSharp.Logging

This package is used by [LambdaSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LambdaSharp/) and [LambdaSharp.App](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LambdaSharp.App/) to provide logging functionality to AWS Lambda functions and Blazor WebAssembly applications, respectively

## Logging

The `ILambdaSharpLogger` interface defines logging methods to make it easy to report information to CloudWatch Logs and optionally to an error aggregator, such as Rollbar.

* `LogDebug()`: Log a debugging message. This message will only appear in the log when debug logging is enabled and will not be forwarded to an error aggregator.
* `LogInfo()`: Log an informational message. This message will only appear in the log and not be forwarded to an error aggregator.
* `LogWarn()`: Log a warning message. This message will be reported if an error aggregator is configured for the <c>LambdaSharp.Core</c> module.
* `LogError()`: Log an exception as an error. This message will be reported if an error aggregator is configured for the <c>LambdaSharp.Core</c> module.
* `LogErrorAsInfo()`: Log an exception as an information message. This message will only appear in the log and not be forwarded to an error aggregator.
* `LogErrorAsWarning()`: Log an exception as a warning. This message will be reported if an error aggregator is configured for the <c>LambdaSharp.Core</c> module.
* `LogFatal()`: Log an exception with a custom message as a fatal error. This message will be reported if an error aggregator is configured for the <c>LambdaSharp.Core</c> module.
* `LogMetric()`: Log a CloudWatch metric. The metric is picked up by CloudWatch logs and automatically ingested as a CloudWatch metric.
