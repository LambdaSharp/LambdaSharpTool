# LambdaSharp CLI - Delete Orphaned Lambda CloudWatch Logs Command

The `util delete-orphan-lambda-logs` command is used to delete CloudWatch log groups that were created by Lambda functions which no longer exist. Note, λ# modules always clean up their Lambda logs. However, if you have been experimenting with Lambda functions in the past, you may a log of CloudWatch logs that are just sitting there for no reason. This command will take care of them.

## Options

<dd>(optional) Show the result of the clean-up operation without deleting anything</dd>

</dl>
