## ALambdaEventFunction<TMessage>

The `ALambdaEventFunction<TMessage>` base class deserializes the body of the CloudWatch event into the specified type parameter. The event object can be accessed using the `CurrentEvent` property.

```csharp
public sealed class Function : ALambdaEventFunction<EventMessage> {

    //--- Constructors ---
    public Function() : base(new LambdaSharp.Serialization.LambdaSystemTextJsonSerializer()) { }

    //--- Methods ---
    public override async Task InitializeAsync(LambdaConfig config) {

        // TO-DO: add function initialization and reading configuration settings
    }

    public override async Task ProcessEventAsync(EventMessage message) {

        // TO-DO: add business logic
    }
}
```
