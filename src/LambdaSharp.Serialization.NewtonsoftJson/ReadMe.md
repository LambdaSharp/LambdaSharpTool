# LambdaSharp.Serialization.NewtonsoftJson

This package implements a Lambda JSON serializer using the popular [JSON.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) package. It is only recommended for legacy projects that require compatibility with JSON.NET annotations. New projects should use `LambdaSystemTextJsonSerializer` provided by the [LambdaSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LambdaSharp/) package.

## Serialization

The construtor takes an optional callback to customize the JSON.NET serialization settings.

```csharp
new LambdaSharp.Serialization.NewtonsoftJson(settings => {
    settings.NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Include;
})
```
