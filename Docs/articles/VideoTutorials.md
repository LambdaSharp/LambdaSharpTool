# Video Tutorials

## Getting Started

It's easy to get started building Serverless .NET application on AWS with LambdaSharp. In in this 10 minute tutorial, we will install the LambdaSharp CLI, create a configuration for it, and a deployment tier for your LambdaSharp modules. Along the way, I will explain what resources are part of the configuration and deployment tier and what purpose they play.

## First Module

In this video, I'm going through the steps for creating your first Serverless .NET module for AWS using  LambdaSharp. The whole tutorial takes less than 10 minutes. Along the way, I also show how to use CloudFormation parameters to parametrize your module and show how they are resolved interactively at deployment time.

## AWS re:Invent 2020: Serverless .NET on AWS with LambdaSharp

Learn how you can build and deploy your serverless solution in minutes using LambdaSharp, an open-source CLI and framework for serverless .NET Core application development on AWS. The solution shares the same C# code for the backend and front end leveraging AWS Lambda functions and the Blazor WebAssembly framework. Finally, see a demonstration of how easy it is to integrate with Amazon CloudWatch Logs, metrics, and Amazon EventBridge.

## Serverless .NET Patterns: Service Composition

This presentation covers some of the serverless design patterns, such as CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Separation), CloudFormation stacks, sharing of resources, nested vs. side-by-side composition, and then put it all together with some code samples found at: https://github.com/LambdaSharp/ServerlessPatterns-ServiceComposition
