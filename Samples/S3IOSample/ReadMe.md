# LambdaSharp `LambdaSharp.S3.IO` Module

Before you begin, make sure to [setup your λ# CLI](../../Docs/ReadMe.md).

## Module Capabilities

The `LambdaSharp.S3.IO` module contains resource type definitions to make it easier to work with S3 buckets.
* `LambdaSharp::S3::EmptyBucket`: This resource does nothing on creation or update, but when deleted it empties the contents of the associated S3 bucket.
* `LambdaSharp::S3::WriteJson`: This resource is used to write a JSON file to an S3 bucket using information.
* `LambdaSharp::S3::Unzip`: This resource unzips an archive into an S3 bucket.

To access these additional resource types, the `LambdaSharp.S3.IO` module must be referenced in the `Using` section of the module.

## Module Definition

The following module definition does the following:
1. It references the `LambdaSharp.S3.IO` to import its definitions.
1. It creates a new bucket.
1. It then copies the contents of the `WebsiteContents` package to it, which include the `index.html` and `error.html` files.
1. It then writes the module parameters to a JSON file in the S3 bucket so that the values can be loaded by the HTML files.
1. Finally, it registers the bucket with the `LambdaSharp::S3::EmptyBucket` so that the bucket is emptied automatically when the module is torn down.
